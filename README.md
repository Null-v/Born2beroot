Project for 42_Roma

This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.
